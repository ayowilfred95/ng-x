![NG-X Landing page](/img/Welcome%20page.png)



Healthcare has been facing a lot of challenges in Nigeria especially loss of data on a patient which can lead poor information on a patients illness and previous treatment which can lead to death. You can now manage your healthcare record in one place and you can access anywhere, anytime. Join now [NG-X](https://ng-x-ayowilfred95.vercel.app/)


## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Question Time

### üë®‚Äçüî¨ What is the product used for?

Modern state administration is a data-driven endeavor. Managing enormous amounts of data is necessary to ensure the state's functionality. Nigeria doesn't have a central or main database. Data is stored where it is created. State authorities and agencies require data outside of their purviews in order to operate, and each manages its own data independently so that data is never duplicated.

The police, for instance, often use information from the population register, while hospitals and other healthcare facilities rely on data from the health information system. How can authorities transmit sensitive information safely?

- The information must first be readily available to the authorities who are authorized to use it.
- The data's integrity must also be preserved. No third party should be able to make any changes to the data while it is in transit.
- Third, the data must remain confidential during its journey. It must be protected from the eyes of unauthorized parties.

NG-X is a data exchange platform that fulfils all three of these requirements.

NG-X makes life easier for the government and the people. For instance, when a child is born, the population register should¬†receive¬†information on the birth straight from the hospital. So that the child¬†has can get¬†a family doctor, which¬†is then immediately submitted to the health information system.

By doing this, time is saved and unnecessary paperwork is avoided . NG-X helps authorities make work processes more convenient. Automation of many tasks allows workers to focus on those that call for human interaction. Authorities also don't have to worry about the authenticity of data.

They can be certain that the information they obtained from the tax board really came from the tax board. Additionally, NG-X can be used regardless of what technology and authority is used for the country. Above all, NG-X makes it feasible for authorities to share data effectively among themselves.

The system itself is so robust that individuals with nefarious intents cannot readily bring it down, and sensitive information transfers safely.

Additionally, NG-X enables the sharing of data outside of the nation. between international boundaries Of course, it assumes that databases and information systems function well. The residents are, of course, the largest winners from NG-X. They save all of the time they would have otherwise spent turning in paperwork and forms, and they get the advantages of a better operating country.

However, the scope we would be covering for this hackathon would be focused on healthcare. Patients lose their lives due to the loss of data or access to data about their health records which can include previous health conditions, allergies, and other important information. In order to close this gap and provide quick access to citizens' health information to support correct treatment administration and lower the fatality rate brought on by a lack of accurate patient information, NG-X was developed.

The NG-X healthcare system enables citizens to manage their prescriptions, submit health information, and manage dependents (spouse, wife, children, and other relatives). Citizens also have control over who has access to their health information and may withdraw this access.

From the citizens end, citizens are onboarded with their NIN which would be linked to the generated unique ID to access NG-X. They further provide other basic information about themselves or dependencies they are managing.

On the provider end, when patient visits the pharmacy, hospitals or family doctor, these healthcare providers can easily lookup the patients information using the healthcare providers portal and providing the patients or citizen's Unique ID. Once provided only information required by the healthcare provider would be displayed based on their role. For example the pharmacy can only access the citizens prescriptions information. Healthcare providers are manually onboarded after proper background check to ensure the safety of the users.
